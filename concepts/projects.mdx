A **project** in ToolDesk is a self-contained application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. Projects live in the `packages/` directory of your workspace.

## Project Structure

Every project has this structure:

```
packages/my-project/
├── package.json           # Project metadata
├── node/                  # Node.js backend
│   └── index.ts           # Backend API
└── web/                   # React frontend
    ├── index.html         # HTML entry
    └── src/
        ├── App.tsx        # Main React component
        ├── main.tsx       # React entry point
        └── styles.css     # Styles
```

## The Frontend (`web/`)

Your React application lives here. The main component is `App.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>My Project</h1>
      <p>Edit this file to get started!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The frontend:

- Renders inside an embedded preview in ToolDesk
- Updates automatically as you edit (hot reload)
- Can call backend methods through `window.__devCanvasAPI`

## The Backend (`node/`)

Your Node.js code lives here. Export an object with async methods:

```typescript
const api = {
  hello: async () => {
    return "Hello from the backend!";
  },

  listFiles: async (path: string) => {
    const fs = await import("fs/promises");
    return fs.readdir(path);
  },
};

export default api;
```

The backend:

- Has access to Node.js APIs (`fs`, `path`, `os`, etc.)
- Runs in a sandboxed environment
- Methods are available on `window.__devCanvasAPI` in your frontend

## Creating Projects

Projects are typically created with AI assistance:

1. Click **+** in ToolDesk to create a new project
2. Open your workspace in an AI coding tool (like Cursor)
3. Ask your AI to build the app, referencing `AGENTS.md`

The AI will create your frontend components and backend methods based on your requirements.

## Project Identification

For ToolDesk to recognize a directory as a project, its `package.json` must include the `tooldesk` attribute:

```json
{
  "name": "@workspace/my-project",
  "tooldesk": {}
}
```

This is automatically added when you create projects through ToolDesk.

## Opening and Closing Projects

- **Open** — Click a project in the sidebar to open it
- **Close** — Click the × on a project tab
- **Session restore** — ToolDesk remembers which projects you had open

## Managing Projects

Right-click a project in the sidebar to:

- **Rename** — Change the project name
- **Delete** — Remove the project permanently
- **Project Settings** — Configure sandbox permissions and icon
