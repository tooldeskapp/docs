A **workspace** in ToolDesk is a directory that contains all your projects. It uses npm workspaces to manage multiple projects, sharing dependencies across them.

## Workspace Structure

When you select a workspace directory, ToolDesk creates this structure:

```
my-workspace/
├── package.json          # Workspace configuration
├── node_modules/         # Shared dependencies
├── AGENTS.md             # AI context file
└── packages/             # Your projects live here
    ├── project-a/
    ├── project-b/
    └── project-c/
```

## The AGENTS.md File

The workspace includes an `AGENTS.md` file that provides context for AI coding tools. When you use AI to build your apps, point it to this file so it understands:

- The project structure
- How to use the ToolDesk API
- Where to put frontend and backend code

<Tip>
  When prompting your AI, start with: "Look at AGENTS.md to understand the project structure."
</Tip>

## The packages/ Directory

All your projects are stored in the `packages/` directory. Each subdirectory is an independent project:

```
packages/
├── file-explorer/        # A file browsing tool
├── api-dashboard/        # An API monitoring tool
└── note-taker/           # A notes application
```

## Shared Dependencies

Dependencies like React and TypeScript are installed at the workspace level and shared across all projects. This means:

- Faster project creation (no duplicate installs)
- Consistent versions across projects
- Smaller disk usage

## Selecting a Workspace

When you first launch ToolDesk:

1. Click **Select Folder** to open the directory picker
2. Choose an existing directory or create a new one
3. ToolDesk sets up the workspace structure
4. Dependencies are installed automatically

You can change your workspace later in **Settings**.

## Multiple Workspaces

You can have multiple workspaces on your system, but ToolDesk works with one at a time. To switch:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Click **Change** next to the workspace path
3. Select a different directory
