title: "Sandbox Permissions"
description: "Configure what your Node.js backend can access"
---

ToolDesk runs your Node.js code in a sandboxed environment. By default, sandboxed code has very limited access. This guide explains how to configure permissions for your projects.

## Accessing Permissions

To configure sandbox permissions:

1. Right-click your project in the sidebar
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Toggle the permissions you need
4. Changes take effect immediately

## Available Permissions

### Full Read Access

**What it allows:** Reading any file on the filesystem.

**When to use:** File explorers, code analyzers, backup tools.

```typescript
const api = {
  readFile: async (path: string) => {
    const fs = await import("fs");
    return fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8");
  },
};
```

<Warning>
  Full read access lets your code read sensitive files. Only enable for trusted code.
</Warning>

### Workspace Read/Write

**What it allows:** Reading and writing files within your project directory.

**When to use:** Most projects that need to save data or configuration.

```typescript
const api = {
  saveData: async (filename: string, data: string) => {
    const fs = await import("fs");
    const path = await import("path");
    const projectDir = process.env.PROJECT_DIR!;
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(projectDir, filename), data);
  },
};
```

The `PROJECT_DIR` environment variable contains your project's absolute path.

### /tmp Access

**What it allows:** Reading and writing in the `/tmp` directory.

**When to use:** Temporary file processing, caching.

### Network Access

**What it allows:** Making outbound network requests (HTTP, HTTPS).

**When to use:** API clients, data fetchers.

```typescript
const api = {
  fetchData: async (url: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    return response.json();
  },
};
```

## Permission Combinations

Common combinations for different project types:

| Project Type | Full Read | Workspace R/W | Network |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| API Client | No | No | Yes |
| File Viewer | Yes | No | No |
| File Editor | Yes | Yes | No |
| Web Scraper | No | Yes | Yes |

## Common Errors

If you see permission errors, enable the appropriate permission:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `EACCES: permission denied` | Enable read or write access |
| `fetch failed` | Enable network access |
| `EROFS: read-only file system` | Enable workspace write access |

## Best Practices

1. **Start restrictive** — Begin with no permissions, add as needed
2. **Protect AI experiments** — Sandbox helps when testing AI-generated code
3. **Use workspace access** — Prefer workspace access over full filesystem
4. **Enable only what's needed** — Minimize permissions for each project
