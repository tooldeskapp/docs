ToolDesk projects are designed to be created with AI assistance. This guide explains how to create projects and use AI tools effectively.

## Creating a New Project

1. Click the **+** button in the ToolDesk title bar
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., `file-browser`)
3. Click **Create**

ToolDesk generates a project with this structure:

```
packages/file-browser/
├── package.json           # Project metadata
├── node/
│   └── index.ts           # Backend API
└── web/
    ├── index.html
    └── src/
        ├── App.tsx        # Main React component
        ├── main.tsx
        └── styles.css
```

## Building with AI

The workspace includes an `AGENTS.md` file that explains the project structure to AI tools. When using AI to build your app:

1. Open your workspace in an AI coding tool (like Cursor)
2. Point the AI to `AGENTS.md` for context
3. Describe what you want to build

### Example Prompts

**File Browser:**
```
Look at AGENTS.md to understand the project structure.

Create a file browser in the "file-browser" package:
- Show a list of files and folders
- Click folders to navigate into them
- Show file sizes and modification dates
- Add a "Go Up" button to navigate to parent directory
```

**API Dashboard:**
```
Look at AGENTS.md to understand the project structure.

Create an API dashboard in the "api-dashboard" package:
- Fetch data from https://api.example.com/stats
- Display the data in a nice card layout
- Add a refresh button
- Show loading and error states
```

**Project Launcher:**
```
Look at AGENTS.md to understand the project structure.

Create a project launcher in the "launcher" package:
- Let users bookmark project directories
- Click a project to open it in Cursor
- Use window.__devCanvasAPI.shell.openApplication("Cursor", [path])
```

## What AGENTS.md Contains

The `AGENTS.md` file tells AI tools:

- How the monorepo workspace is structured
- That each package has `web/` and `node/` directories
- How to use `window.__devCanvasAPI` to call backend methods
- How to use the shell API for system operations

<Tip>
  If your AI isn't producing the right code, check that it's reading `AGENTS.md` and understanding the ToolDesk API pattern.
</Tip>

## After Creation

Once your project is created:

1. The project opens in ToolDesk's preview
2. Open the workspace in your AI coding tool
3. Start prompting your AI to build features

## Configuring Permissions

If your app needs filesystem or network access:

1. Right-click the project in the sidebar
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Enable the permissions you need

See [Sandbox Permissions](/guides/sandbox-permissions) for details.

## Project Naming

Use lowercase names with hyphens:

| Good | Avoid |
|------|-------|
| `file-browser` | `File Browser` |
| `api-dashboard` | `ApiDashboard` |
| `note-taker` | `note_taker` |
