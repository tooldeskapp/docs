This guide walks you through installing ToolDesk, setting up a workspace, and creating your first project with AI.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS 11+** (Big Sur or later)
- **Node.js 18+** ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **An AI coding tool** like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) or an AI assistant

## Step 1: Install ToolDesk

Download the latest release from GitHub:

<Card title="Download for macOS" icon="apple" href="https://github.com/tooldesk/releases/latest">
  Get the `.dmg` installer for macOS
</Card>

Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag ToolDesk to your Applications folder.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace

When you first launch ToolDesk:

1. Click **Select Folder** to choose a workspace directory
2. ToolDesk creates the workspace structure and installs dependencies
3. Wait for the initialization to complete

Your workspace is where all your projects live. It's a standard npm workspace that your AI tools can understand and work with.

## Step 3: Create a Project with AI

ToolDesk is designed for AI-assisted development. The workspace includes an `AGENTS.md` file that gives AI tools context about the project structure.

1. Click the **+** button to create a new project
2. Enter a project name (e.g., `file-browser`)
3. Open the workspace in your AI coding tool (like Cursor)
4. Ask your AI to build your app

<Tip>
  The `AGENTS.md` file in your workspace root explains the project structure to AI tools. Point your AI to this file for context.
</Tip>

### Example AI Prompt

```
Look at AGENTS.md to understand the project structure.

Create a file browser app in the "file-browser" package that:
- Lists files and directories
- Lets me navigate between folders
- Shows file sizes and dates

Use window.__devCanvasAPI for the backend methods.
```

## Step 4: Understanding the API

Your frontend can call backend methods through `window.__devCanvasAPI`:

```typescript
// In your frontend (web/src/App.tsx)

// Declare the types for your API methods
declare global {
  interface Window {
    __devCanvasAPI: {
      listFiles: (path: string) => Promise<FileInfo[]>;
      readFile: (path: string) => Promise<string>;
      shell: {
        openExternal: (url: string) => Promise<void>;
        openApplication: (appName: string, args?: string[]) => Promise<void>;
      };
    };
  }
}

// Call your backend methods
const files = await window.__devCanvasAPI.listFiles("/Users/me/Documents");

// Open apps or URLs
await window.__devCanvasAPI.shell.openApplication("Finder", ["/Users/me"]);
await window.__devCanvasAPI.shell.openExternal("https://example.com");
```

The API automatically connects to your backend. Any method you export from `node/index.ts` becomes available on `window.__devCanvasAPI`.

## Step 5: Configure Permissions

If your app needs to access the filesystem or network, configure permissions:

1. Right-click your project in the sidebar
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Enable the permissions you need:
   - **Full Read Access** — Read any file on your system
   - **Workspace Read/Write** — Read and write in your project folder
   - **Network Access** — Make HTTP requests

<Warning>
  Sandbox permissions protect you from unintended side effects of AI-generated code. Only enable what you need.
</Warning>
