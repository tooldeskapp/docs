ToolDesk is a macOS desktop application that lets you build small web applications with AI assistance. Your apps run in a **sandboxed environment**, so you can safely experiment with AI-generated code without worrying about unintended side effects on your system.

## Why ToolDesk?

When you use AI to generate code, you want to run it safely. ToolDesk provides:

- **Sandboxed execution** — AI-generated Node.js code runs with restricted permissions
- **React frontend** — Build UIs with React, rendered in an embedded preview
- **Node.js backend** — Access the filesystem, network, and system APIs
- **Real-time preview** — See your changes instantly as you develop

<Note>
  ToolDesk is designed for **AI-assisted development**. Use your favorite AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to generate and modify your apps.
</Note>

## How It Works

Each ToolDesk project has two parts:

| Part | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | `web/` | React application for the UI |
| **Backend** | `node/` | Node.js code with system access |

Your frontend can call backend methods through a simple API:

```typescript
// Call your backend methods
const files = await window.__devCanvasAPI.listFiles("/Users/me/Documents");

// Use built-in shell methods
await window.__devCanvasAPI.shell.openApplication("Cursor", ["/path/to/project"]);
```

## Use Cases

ToolDesk is perfect for building:

- **Developer tools** — Code generators, file processors, project scaffolders
- **Local utilities** — File organizers, batch processors, data transformers
- **API clients** — Dashboard tools that interact with external services
- **Prototypes** — Quick experiments that need backend functionality
